# Raycasting Engine

A simple raycasting engine written in **C++**, inspired by classic games like **Wolfenstein 3D**. This project demonstrates how to create a pseudo-3D environment using 2D techniques.

## Features

- 2D to 3D raycasting engine
- Player movement and input handling
- Scene rendering with wall textures
- Map parsing from plain text files
- Texture support (`.xpm`)
- Easily extendable map and scene system

Build Instructions
Prerequisites
A `C++17` compatible compiler (e.g., **g++, clang++**)

`make`

This will compile the project and create an executable in the root directory.

Running the Program
After compilation, you can run the program using:
`./rc`


# Maps
You can find several predefined maps in the `maps/` directory. Each map file represents a 2D grid that the engine interprets for wall positions.

# Textures
Textures are stored in the textures/ directory in .xpm or .raw format.Texture mapping using basic linear algebra (vectors, angles)

# Concepts Used **Raycasting algorithm**
